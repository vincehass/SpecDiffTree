It's the most massive planet in our solar system, and its composition is thought to be similar to that of the Sun.\n- **Atmospheric Conditions:** Jupiter's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, but it's also composed of a strong magnetic field and a system of strong winds and storm systems.\n\n### Unique Features\n\n- **Great Red Spot:** Jupiter has a famous and persistent anticyclonic storm, known as the Great Red Spot, which has been raging for",
